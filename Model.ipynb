    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Wildfires are one of the most harmful phenomena in Chile burning thousands of forest hectares every year destroying significant flora and fauna, and affecting the air, water cycles, and the ecosystem. Wildfires start by varied reasons, ranging from reckless human behavior to extreme weather and environmental conditions\n",

    "## Main Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a mathematical model based on SPDE qualitatively realistic with the phenomenon behaviour. \n",

    "1. Start with an agent based model, working with the weather conditions and initial fires focus. \n",
    "2. Get a continuous model based on SPDE from the ABM.\n",
